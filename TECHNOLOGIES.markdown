# Technologies Used in Research Agent

The Research Agent project leverages the following technologies for development and deployment:

- **IBM Watsonx AI Studio**: Platform for building, training, and deploying the AI agent, providing an integrated environment for model management and task automation.
- **IBM Granite Foundation Model**: Advanced NLP model for semantic search, text summarization, and recommendation generation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage (Lite Plan)**: Storage solution for managing datasets and vector indices for efficient document retrieval.
- **IBM Cloud Lite Services**: Scalable cloud infrastructure for hosting the agent and supporting API integrations.
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and agent logic.
- **pandas**: Python library for manipulating and analyzing academic metadata (e.g., titles, abstracts).
- **requests**: Python library for optional API calls to external data sources (e.g., arXiv, PubMed) in production.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Technique for combining document retrieval with text generation to provide context-aware responses.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Core methodology for query parsing, summarization, and multilingual support.

These technologies enable the Research Agent to deliver accurate, efficient, and scalable research assistance for academic and R&D applications.
